PRODIGY_FS-02

Developed a web application that allows administrators to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on employee records. Users can be add new employees, view existing employee details, update employee information, and delete employee records.The system has proper validation and authentication mechanisms to protect sensitive employee data. I have used Flask for the backend and React for the frontend. The data is stored in a sqlite3 database.
